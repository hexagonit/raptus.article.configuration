Developer Manual
================

Note: You find a developer manual for raptus.article at 
`raptus.article.core <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptus.article.core>`_.
Please have look there if you need more information.

Code overview
=============

Interfaces
----------

IConfigurableArticle
````````````````````
Marker interface for Articles with context-aware component
configuration.

Adapters
--------

PlacefulComponentsConfiguration
```````````````````````````````
Provides lookup of placeful Components configuration. It finds the
configuration key by looking first on context, then on all parents
in acquisition chain and lastly in portal_properties.

Usage in raptus.article.* packages
==================================

Some of raptus.article.* packages do not yet support placeful configuration
because they read configuration straight from portal_properties and not via
IComponentsConfiguration provider.

Updating them with support for placeful configuration is quite simple and is
best shown with an example of getting gallery description in
raptus.article.gallery::

    - props = getToolByName(self.context, 'portal_properties').raptus_article
    - return props.getProperty('gallery_%s_description' % self.type, False)
    + from raptus.article.core.interfaces import IComponentsConfiguration
    + return IComponentsConfiguration(self.context).get('gallery_%s_description' % self.type, False)

After this change is done, configuration will still be read from
portal_properties by default. To change configuration per-context, you need
to install raptus.article.configuration and then add a 'gallery_%s_description'
property to the Article of your choice.
